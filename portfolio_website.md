### Project: **Responsive Portfolio Website**

#### Objective
Create a responsive portfolio website for a fictional photographer. This project will assess your skills in building a responsive layout, creating an interactive gallery, and adding polished animations for a smooth user experience.

#### Requirements

1. **Landing Page:**
   - Design a simple, clean hero section with a background image, the photographer’s name, and a tagline.
   - Include a “View Portfolio” button with smooth scrolling to the Portfolio section.
   - Set up a navigation bar that stays fixed at the top, with links to each section (Home, Portfolio, About, Contact).

2. **Portfolio Section:**
   - Build a gallery to display images in a grid layout.
   - Enable each image to open in a lightbox view when clicked.
   - Add category buttons for filtering images by type (e.g., Nature, Portraits, Urban), allowing dynamic filtering based on the category selected.

3. **About Section:**
   - Write a short bio about the photographer, include a list of skills, and display the tools or technologies used (e.g., Photoshop, DSLR).
   - Use cards or icons to represent these tools and skills.

4. **Contact Form:**
   - Set up a contact form with fields for Name, Email, Message, and a Submit button.
   - Implement form validation using JavaScript to check for empty fields and validate the email format.
   - Display a success message or highlight any errors upon form submission.

5. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure the website is fully responsive and works well on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
   - Implement a collapsible navigation bar on smaller screens.

6. **CSS & Animations:**
   - Use Bootstrap for layout and base styling, adding custom CSS for additional control and styling.
   - Add smooth transitions and animations, such as hover effects on images and buttons.
   - Make sure there’s smooth scrolling when users navigate between sections.

#### Estimated Timeline

This project is expected to take **approximately 12-16 hours**. Take your time to ensure each section is well-designed and user-friendly.
